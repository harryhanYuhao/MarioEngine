Added alpha blending and z index.
    Sprites and renderbatch constructors now take a z index parameter.
    Sprites are rendered in the order for their z index.

Added and configured imgui interface.
There has been a problem with git version control and today's works were almost lost forever,
luckily I have managed to retrieve them.
Take home message: be careful with git and make sure to commit often.

Java imgui is rather peculiar: it does not have a good documentation. However, as it is based on dear Imgui
written in C++, many code can be transferred into java.
See Dear imgui documentation in GitHub.

Serilization with reflection by Gson.
imgui now can be used in leveleditor scene to change properties of the activeGameObject. The data is stored in
"assets/levels/level1.json" file. The next time program runs the data will be automatically deserialized and
loaded into each game object.
Gson serialization and deserialization is customly defined in GameObjectDeserializer and ComponentDesrializer.
So far we have not implement how to change activeGameObject.

The components class was edited so that when a new component is added to gameobject, imgui will have roll bar
to change the component's properties.

For some reason when a new component is added to the gameobject, the level1.jason file will be be updated.
Thus to upgrade the change I have to manually wipe the file and run twice (the first time to generate the file
only after the file is generated the imgui window will be updated)

Bug fixed: I have added/modified the component after its gameobject is added to scene.
The situation now is: the gameobject will be corrected loaded the first time. However, if after loading
the properties of gameobject is manually changed, we have to wipe the jason file and run the program agine.
