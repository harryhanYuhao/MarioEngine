Added alpha blending and z index.
    Sprites and renderbatch constructors now take a z index parameter.
    Sprites are rendered in the order for their z index.

Added and configured imgui interface.
There has been a problem with git version control and today's works were almost lost forever,
luckily I have managed to retrieve them.
Take home message: be careful with git and make sure to commit often.

Java imgui is rather peculiar: it does not have a good documentation. However, as it is based on dear Imgui
written in C++, many code can be transferred into java.
See Dear imgui documentation in GitHub.
